# Privacy Policy

Bate que eu gosto (BQEG) operates as an Amazon Alexa Skill created by Gabriel Rodrigues dos Santos. It is BQEG's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating.

We use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Users of BQEG's skill interact with BQEG in ways that require BQEG to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BQEG are the employeer's code and employee's pin code. For example, we use the provided data to fetch information about working hours and punch the clock. BQEG collects such information to fulfill the purpose of the users's interaction with BQEG. BQEG does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information.

## Information We Collect from Other Sources

With your authorization, we also obtain information about you from other sources, such as tangerino, where we fetch the working hours or punch the clock.

## Data Retention Policy

We will retain the user provided data (user employeer code and user pin code) for a better experience, but users may ask to remove them anytime by asking 'apagar todos os meus dados'.

## Log Data

To be able to investigate issues with the skill, BQEG stores logs with Amazon CloudWatch. These logs may included personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

BQEG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BQEG's behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by using BQEG's skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BQEG will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, as described above, BQEG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when BQEG believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BQEG, third parties or the public at large. BQEG takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
